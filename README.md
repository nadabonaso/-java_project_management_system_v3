# Project Management System with Java and MySQL 

## About

This is a Project Management System for an engineering firm called "Poised" that allows the company to add, track and management payments of their projects. 

It is capable of adding multiple projects and contacts. Each new project has contacts and can be edited after creation. All projects can be tracked with reports and also be finalised with an invoice generated if there is still an outstanding balance owed. 

It is built in Java and incorporates a MySQL database to store all the project and contact information. I also used JavaDoc.
